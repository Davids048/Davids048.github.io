I am an undergradute student at Rice University studying computer science. Iâ€™m applying for Master Programs and Ph.D. programs in the Fall 2024 cycle. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of efficient ML and systems. I am interested in developing efficient LLM algorithms, as well as hardware-aware systems that speed up these architectures. 

My last project focused on developing a concurrent LLM adapter serving system tailored for structural sparse BOFT adapters, achieving a 2.12x speedup over S-LoRA when serving 96 adapters using a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. We developed a unified matrix multiplication operation that enabled efficient adapter batching using Triton kernels. Our paper is accepted in ES-FOMO at ICML'24 and in submission to EMNLP'2024. Currently, I'm working on integrating a newly developed 2-bit quantization scheme (KIVI) into TensorRT-LLM.
